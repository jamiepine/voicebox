## Development Workflow

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voicebox.git
cd voicebox
```

### 2. Create a Branch

Use descriptive branch names:

```bash
# For features
git checkout -b feature/voice-effects

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/audio-playback-issue

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/api-examples
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code Style">
    **TypeScript/React:**
    - Use TypeScript strict mode
    - Prefer functional components with hooks
    - Use named exports
    - Format with Biome (runs automatically)

    **Python:**
    - Follow PEP 8
    - Use type hints
    - Use async/await for I/O
    - Document functions with docstrings

    **Rust:**
    - Follow Rust conventions
    - Use meaningful names
    - Handle errors explicitly
    - Run `rustfmt`

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit Messages">
    Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

    ```bash
    # Good
    git commit -m "Add voice profile export feature"
    git commit -m "Fix audio playback stopping after 30 seconds"

    # Avoid
    git commit -m "Update code"
    git commit -m "Fix bug"
    ```

    Format:
    - Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    - Keep first line under 50 characters
    - Add detailed description if needed

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing">
    - Test your changes manually in the app
    - Ensure backend API endpoints work
    - Check for TypeScript/Python errors
    - Verify UI components render correctly
    - Add automated tests when possible
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 4. Push & Create PR

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Then create a pull request on GitHub
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

When creating a pull request:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use a Clear Title">
    Examples:
    - "Add voice profile export functionality"
    - "Fix audio playback stopping after 30 seconds"
    - "Improve generation speed with caching"
  </Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Provide Description">
	Include: - What changes you made - Why you made them - How to test them -
	Screenshots (for UI changes) - Reference related issues
</Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Update Documentation">
	- Update relevant docs if behavior changes - Add API documentation for new
	endpoints - Update README if needed
</Step>

  <Step title="Check the Checklist">
    - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
    - [ ] Documentation updated
    - [ ] Changes tested
    - [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)
    - [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Development

When adding new API endpoints:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Route">
    In `backend/main.py`:

    ```python
    @app.post("/api/new-endpoint")
    async def new_endpoint(data: RequestModel) -> ResponseModel:
        """Endpoint description."""
        # Implementation
        return response
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Models">
    In `backend/models.py`:

    ```python
    class RequestModel(BaseModel):
        field: str

    class ResponseModel(BaseModel):
        result: str
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Regenerate Client">
    ```bash
    bun run generate:api
    ```

    This updates the TypeScript client with type-safe bindings.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Docs">
    The API documentation is automatically generated from the OpenAPI schema. Ensure your endpoint has proper docstrings and type hints, then regenerate the docs:
    
    ```bash
    bun run generate:api
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing

Currently testing is primarily manual. When adding tests:

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
bun run test
```

**E2E (future):**

```bash
bun run test:e2e
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers using `bumpversion`:

```bash
# Bump version (patch, minor, or major)
bumpversion patch

# Push with tags
git push && git push --tags
```

GitHub Actions automatically builds and publishes releases when tags are pushed.
