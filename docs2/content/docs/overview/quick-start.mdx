This guide will walk you through creating your first voice profile and generating speech.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [installed Voicebox](/overview/installation) and launched the app.

## Step 1: Create a Voice Profile

Voice profiles are the foundation of Voicebox. Each profile contains voice samples that the AI uses to clone the voice.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Profiles">
    Click the **Profiles** tab in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Profile">
    Click the **+ New Profile** button

    Fill in the details:
    - **Name:** A descriptive name (e.g., "John Smith")
    - **Language:** Select the primary language
    - **Description:** Optional notes about the voice
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Voice Sample">
    You have two options:

    **Option A: Upload Audio**
    - Click **Upload Sample**
    - Select an audio file (WAV, MP3, or M4A)
    - Ideal length: 10-30 seconds of clear speech

    **Option B: Record Live**
    - Click **Record Sample**
    - Speak clearly for 10-30 seconds
    - Click stop when finished
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Profile">
    Click **Create Profile** to save
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  For best results, use clean audio with minimal background noise and consistent speaking tone.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Generate Speech

Now let's use your new voice profile to generate speech.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Generation">
    Click the **Generate** tab in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Voice Profile">
    Choose your newly created profile from the dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Text">
    Type or paste the text you want to generate:

    ```
    Hello! This is my first voice generation with Voicebox.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate">
    Click **Generate** and wait a few seconds

    <Note>
      First generation may take longer due to model initialization. Subsequent generations will be faster.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Play & Download">
    - Click **Play** to preview the audio
    - Click **Download** to save the audio file
    - The generation is also saved to your **History**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Build a Story (Optional)

The Stories Editor lets you create multi-voice narratives with a timeline-based interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Story">
    Navigate to **Stories** and click **+ New Story**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Voice Tracks">
    Click **+ Add Track** to create tracks for different speakers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Audio Clips">
    - Drag generated audio from your History
    - Or generate new clips directly in the timeline
    - Arrange clips on the timeline
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit & Export">
    - Trim clips by dragging edges
    - Adjust timing and spacing
    - Click **Export** to render the final audio
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Getting the Best Voice Quality">
    - Use 10-30 seconds of clear, consistent speech
    - Avoid background noise and echo
    - Multiple samples from the same speaker improve quality
    - Match the speaking style you want to generate
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Improving Generation Speed">
    - Use a CUDA-capable GPU for 5-10x faster generation
    - Enable voice prompt caching for repeated generations
    - Consider running the backend on a remote GPU server
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
    - **Server won't start:** Check if port 17493 is available
    - **Poor audio quality:** Try adding more voice samples
    - **Slow generation:** Verify GPU acceleration is enabled
