## Overview

Voice profiles are the foundation of voice cloning in Voicebox. This guide covers best practices for creating professional-quality voice profiles.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
	<Step title="Prepare Audio">10-30 seconds of clear speech</Step>
	<Step title="Create Profile">**Profiles** → **+ New Profile**</Step>
	<Step title="Upload Sample">Add your audio file</Step>
	<Step title="Generate">Use the profile to generate speech</Step>
</Steps>

## Audio Requirements

### Ideal Sample Characteristics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Duration" icon="clock">
    **10-30 seconds**

    Too short: Poor quality
    Too long: Unnecessary

  </Card>
  <Card title="Clarity" icon="volume">
    **Clear speech**

    No background noise
    No music or overlapping voices

  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality" icon="sparkles">
    **High fidelity**

    44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate
    Minimal compression

  </Card>
  <Card title="Content" icon="microphone">
    **Natural speech**

    Conversational tone
    Complete sentences

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### File Formats

Supported formats:

- **WAV** (recommended) - Lossless quality
- **MP3** - Acceptable, minimal compression
- **M4A** - Acceptable
- **FLAC** - Lossless alternative

<Tip>Use WAV for best results. Avoid heavily compressed formats.</Tip>

## Recording Tips

### Environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quiet Space">
    - Record in a quiet room
    - Turn off fans, AC, appliances
    - Close windows to reduce outside noise
    - Use soft furnishings to reduce echo
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="Microphone Placement">
	- 6-12 inches from mouth - Slight angle to reduce plosives (p, b, t) - Use a
	pop filter if available - Maintain consistent distance
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recording Settings">
    - 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate
    - 16-bit or 24-bit depth
    - Mono is fine (stereo will be converted)
    - Avoid automatic gain control
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Speaking

- **Natural pace** - Don't rush or speak too slowly
- **Clear articulation** - Pronounce words clearly
- **Consistent volume** - Maintain steady loudness
- **Normal tone** - Speak as you normally would
- **Complete sentences** - Avoid fragments or "ums"

## Multiple Samples

Adding multiple samples can significantly improve quality:

### Why Multiple Samples?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card title="Robustness" icon="shield">
		Model learns a more complete representation
	</Card>
	<Card title="Versatility" icon="palette">
		Handles different speaking styles better
	</Card>
	<Card title="Quality" icon="star">
		Reduces artifacts and improves naturalness
	</Card>
	<Card title="Consistency" icon="check">
		More reliable across different texts
	</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Sample Variety

Consider adding samples with:

1. **Different tones**

   - Casual conversation
   - Professional/formal
   - Excited/enthusiastic
   - Calm/serious

2. **Different content**

   - Narratives
   - Questions
   - Statements
   - Emotions (happy, sad, neutral)

3. **Different recording conditions**
   - Studio quality
   - Phone call quality (if needed)
   - Room acoustics

<Warning>
	All samples should be from the **same speaker**. Mixing voices will produce
	poor results.
</Warning>

## Processing Existing Audio

If you have existing audio (podcasts, videos, etc.):

### Extracting Clean Segments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Clean Speech">
    Look for segments with:
    - Just the target speaker
    - No background music
    - Minimal noise
  </Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Use Audio Editor">
	Tools like Audacity or Adobe Audition: - Cut out clean 10-30s segments -
	Remove silence at start/end - Normalize volume if needed
</Step>

  <Step title="Export as WAV">
    Save as high-quality WAV file
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Noise Reduction

If you have light background noise:

```
1. Use noise reduction in Audacity:
   - Select noise-only section
   - Get Noise Profile
   - Select full audio
   - Apply noise reduction (gentle settings)

2. Avoid over-processing:
   - Can introduce artifacts
   - May reduce voice quality
```

## Testing & Iteration

### Test Your Profile

After creating a profile:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Test">
    Generate a simple phrase:
    ```
    "Hello, this is a test of my voice profile."
    ```
  </Step>

{" "}
<Step title="Evaluate Quality">
	Listen for: - Natural tone - Clear pronunciation - Proper prosody - Lack of
	artifacts
</Step>

  <Step title="Iterate">
    If quality is poor:
    - Add more samples
    - Try different source audio
    - Check sample quality
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Robotic Voice">
    **Cause**: Poor quality samples or too short

    **Fix**: Use longer, higher quality samples

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong Tone">
    **Cause**: Sample tone doesn't match desired output

    **Fix**: Record samples in the style you want to generate

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Artifacts/Glitches">
    **Cause**: Background noise or audio issues in samples

    **Fix**: Clean up samples or re-record in quieter environment

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Tips

### Celebrity/Character Voices

For cloning public figures or characters:

1. **Legal considerations** - Ensure you have rights or it's fair use
2. **Source quality** - Find high-quality interview audio or clean clips
3. **Consistency** - Use clips where they speak similarly
4. **Multiple samples** - Very important for recognizable voices

### Accent & Dialect

The model will preserve accent and dialect:

- British English will generate British English
- Southern accent will produce Southern accent
- Regional pronunciations will be maintained

### Emotion Transfer

The emotional tone of samples affects generation:

- Energetic samples → Energetic output
- Calm samples → Calm output
- Mix samples for versatile profile

## Managing Profiles

### Organization

- **Descriptive names** - "John Smith - Professional Narrator"
- **Add descriptions** - Note recording conditions, use cases
- **Language tags** - Mark the primary language
- **Archive unused** - Keep profile list manageable

### Export/Import

- **Export** profiles to share or backup
- **Import** from colleagues or teammates
- Profiles include voice embeddings, not original audio
